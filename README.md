## Demo for NodeCPT Redis and React talk 

We demonstrate the use of Redis as a data store for blog posts, and implement a trivial "API server" to serve our JSON content using ExpressJS.

Furthermore, we implement a web server to use ReactJS to render the content as HTML on NodeJS, served by ExpressJS.
